        I was in the greatest ship ever made,

laying in a bunk of advanced polymers,

staring up through a plasma-steel glass portal

at the silver sparks streaming across

the horizon of Neptune’s ice layer,

when the rain started.

 

Ice condensed and superheated,

an off-spray of gas for a trailing tail,

and diamond comets fell like rain,

a mesmerizing rain that shimmered

and refracted light in so many spectrums

that the human mind

could only comprehend a fraction:

 

            Some the size of an engagement ring

that was rejected by the woman of your dreams

simply because it wasn’t enough

for the perfect representation of your relationship.

            Others the size of Rhode Island,

where you first met her.

 

It was beautiful.

It was intense.

It was worth it.

The plasma-steel glass was not enough.
